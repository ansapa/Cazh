# Cazh: Plain-Text Double-Entry Accounting

## What
Cazh is a double-entry accounting app inspired by [beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount).

## Why
I started this project and continue to work on it in my spare time for different reasons:

- Learn, practice and keep up to date with Swift
- Learn SwiftUI
